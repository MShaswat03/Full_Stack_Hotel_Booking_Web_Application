## Project Structure 

- `frontend/` - contains React frontend components 
- `backend/` - contains backend done with Express.js 

The backend serves the information when the specific API route is called. React will call the API to get the relevant information and package that in a nice UI. 

## Install dependencies 

- cd into frontend or backend 
- run `npm install`

## Start express backend 

```bash
npm start 
```

This will start the server and also (nodemon) will listen for any changes upon save and reload the server automatically. 

## Start React frontned 

```bash
npm start
